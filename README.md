# PGC ArcticDEM Introduction Homepage (Independent Project For Master's Program)
I created this website to introduce and demonstrate the usage of ArcticDEM.
I used ArcMap, ArcGIS API for JavaScript and ArcGIS Server to show the wildfire damage in the Northwest Territories, Canada. Then, I embedded the web maps to the website. Web maps are hosted with ArcGIS Server. Website is created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap 3.
