			<p class="h4">Project Scope</p>
			<p>
				In my GIS 8990 Independent class, I decided to use Polar Geospatial Center's ArcticDEM strip product to conduct a landscape change detection analysis in Arctic region.<br><br>
				The research goals are to
				<ul>
					<li>Explore the usage and limitation of ArcticDEM Strips</li>
					<li>Demonstrate and visualize the change detection analysis and share with people</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p class="h4">Data and Technologies</p>
			<p>
				I used a privilege of working at the Polar Geospatial Center to obtain, process, and explore the ArcticDEM, 2m Panchromatic Imagery data. <br>
				Point fire data was obtained from NASA's <a href="https://earthdata.nasa.gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/firms/active-fire-data" target="_blank">EARTHDATA</a>, and polygon fire data was obtained from <a href="http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/datamart" target="_blank">Canadian WIldland Fire Information System</a>.<br>
				<br>
				ArcGIS Desktop 10.51 and ArcGIS Online were used for the analysis.

				<p class="h3">Introduction to Arctic DEM</p>
				<p class="h4">Purpose</p>
				<p>
					The ArcticDEM project is a response to the need for high quality elevation data in remote locations, the availability of technology to process big data, and the need for accurate measurement of topographic change.
				<br><br>
					ArcticDEM will encompass all land area north of 60°N. In addition, coverage will include all territory of Greenland, the State of Alaska in entirety, and the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Russian Federation.
				</p>
				<p class="h4">Source</p>
				<p>
					ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track, high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the DigitalGlobe constellation of optical imaging satellites and licensed through the NGA NextView contact.
				<br><br>
					The majority of ArcticDEM data was generated from the panchromatic bands of the WorldView-1, WorldView-2, and WorldView-3 satellites. A small percentage of data was also generated from the GeoEye-1 satellite sensor.
				</p>
				<p class="h4">Output</p>
				<p>
					Output DEM raster files are available as both “strip” files and mosaic files that are compiled from multiple strips that have been co-registered, blended, and feathered to reduce edge-matching artifacts.
				<br><br>
					The strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over larger areas.

				<p class="h3">Example of Using Arctic DEM</p>
				<p class="h4">Fire in Canada</p>
				<p>The map shows the location points where fire were detected in Canada in 2016. The data is filtered to show only the points above 60&#176; latitude with 85% or more confidence. All the fires are detected in the Northwest Territories.<br>
				If you click the points, you will be able to see the details of the fire. The pop up shows the following information:
				<ul>
					<li>Date when the fire was detected</li>
					<li>Brightness of the fire.(This indicates how strong the fire is)</li>
					<li>The exact time when the satellite detected the fire</li>
					<li>The Satellite name</li>
					<li>Confidence (100 is the max)</li>
				</ul>

				Click the Study Area button to zoom in to the study area for this project.<br>
				The pink polygon shows the damaged area from the wildfire started in July 2016. This data is from LANDSAT. You could see many fire points inside the polygon, and those points are detected between July and August.<br><br>
				The primary reason of selecting this location was the availability of the DEM and cloud free imagery with small amount of holes.<br><br>

				<p class="h4">Process</p>
				<p>The following is the procedure I took:
					<ol>
						<li>Download ArcticDEM Strips and associated orthorectified images from PGC database.</li>
						<li>Created mosaic images and DEM of 2014 and 2016.</li>
						<li>Created hillshade layers from the mosaic DEM.</li>
						<li>Uploaded layers as a WMS to the ArcGIS server.</li>
						<li>Visualize mosaic images and hillshade using ArcGIS API for Javascript (ver. 3.24).</li>
					</ol>
					All the geo-processing were done by ArcGIS Desktop 10.5.<br>
					All the layers from 2016 are obtained after the wildfire (September, October, and November). Layers from 2014 were selected since study area in 2015 had a heavy cloud coverage.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id="imagemap" class="col-md-4">
				<p class="h4">High Resolution Images Comparison</p>
				<p>
					The map has two layers: panchromatic mosaic imagery from 2014 and 2016. You can use the swipe bar to see the changes.<br> The base layer shows the mosaic imagery from 2016. If you swipe the bar to the right, the mosaic imagery from 2014 will appear.<br><br>
					(The reason why 2014 image looks darker is because of the shadow effect.)<br><br>
					Click example 1 and example 2 to zoom into the locations. If you swipe vertically you can see the affect of wildfire.<br><br>
					Example 1: It is difficult to tell the difference due to the difference in sun light affect, but you will be able to see the tree loss in upper part of the small island. <br><br>
					Example 2: In 2016, there are many areas with dark plain texture. If you swipe to the left to see the 2014 imagery, you will be able to see the difference in color and texture. This shows that those areas (with dark plain texture) had tree coverage in 2014.

			</div>
			<div id="hillshademap" class="col-md-4">
				<p class="h4">Hillshade Comparison</p>
				<p>
					The map has two layer like the "Canada Fire Damage Panchromatic Images": hillshade from 2014 and 2016. You can use the swip bar to see the changes with this map as well.<br><br>
					The base layer shows the hillshade from 2016. If you swipe the bar vertically to the right, the hillshade layer from 2014 will appear.<br><br>
					The hillshade map has two same example locations as the imagery map. <br>
					Both example shows that there were land change between 2014 and 2016 since 2016 has more rough surface compared to 2014. 
				</p>
				<p class="h4">Limitation</p>
				<p>
					The limitation I found for this project is the data availability. Even though Arctic DEM mosaic coverage is spectacular, it was hard to find strips with clean whole free cloud free and snow free data within the desired time frame. <br><br>
					When I looked into summer DEM in Alaska where the wildfire was detected for 2014, 2015, and 2016, most of the strips are covered with clouds.<br><br>
					There is aslo aligning error that cannot be fixed without co-registration process. I was not able to apply this method due to the limited time. Therefore, this could be the process I can consider to add in the future study.
